# Machine Learning Reading Group
Welcome the machine learning reading group! Before becoming a part of our community, we kindly request you to review the following information carefully.
## About this group
The topics and content are listed in this [Notion website](https://absorbed-breadfruit-366.notion.site/Machine-Learning-Reading-Group-206d210a777a428baf874b43d0dcb7e4?pvs=4). Each individual is encouraged to select a topic that hasn't already been chosen by others. The duration of the study group is set to span one year.

Meeting schedule: every Tuesday 19:00-20:00

## Formatting
If you're interested in contributing notes, ensure that your content is well-structured and covers motivation, frameworks, algorithms, intricate details and references. Feel free to incorporate key mathematical theorems along with insightful proofs, emphasizing the significance of each theorem and any unique techniques employed in the proofs. Additionally, when inserting images into your notes, please offer sufficient explanations for clarity. We especially focus on the **details**, **not simply the model structure and intuition**. Your notes should be written with **Markdown** (in convenience of editting).

For programming assignment contributors, please provide your environment setting in addition to your code, including:
- computer architecture: x86_64, arm64, ...
- operating system: windows10, windows11, macos big sur, linux, ...
- packages versions, including: python, torch, tensorflow, matplotlob, numpy, ...

There's no restriction to the packages you use. You can use any package you want to use.

Feel free to add comments for clarity. 

## About your presentation
You just have to prepare your notes for your presentation. **Participants are welcome to present even if their notes/code are incomplete**. Active engagement is encouraged. If you get stuck somewhere, we can find the solution together during the meeting.
